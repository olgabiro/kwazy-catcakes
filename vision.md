# Kwazy Catcakes - Vision

## Core Concept
A relaxing, funny, colorful match-3 puzzle game where the player swaps tiles (cupcakes and a few stray kittens) to create matches and trigger satisfying effects.

## Game Loop
1. Player swaps adjacent tiles, to match 3+ items of the same type
2. If the player moves a cat, the cat becomes angry
3. If the action moves a cat, the cat becomes angry
4. When a cat gets triggered 3 times, it scratches the player, costing a heart (player starts with 5 hearts)
5. Successfully matching 3+ items increases the score, the items disappear from the board
6. New tiles fall to fill empty spaces.
7. If 3+ cats get matched in a row, they explode - this costs a heart, but also removes the adjacent elements. The explosion can chain.
8. Game continues until the hearts or moves run out.

## Aesthetic & Mood
- Funny and relaxing.
- Soft, rounded shapes.
- Smooth animations and transitions.
- Gentle background music.

## Inspirations
- "Candy Crush" mechanics
- "Exploding Kittens" vibe

## Stretch Goals
- Combos & chain reactions.
- Power-ups ("clear the row", "clear the column", "clear all cupcake tiles").
- Level progression and scoring milestones.

## Notes
Keep code modular and clean â€” aim for flow and fun.
